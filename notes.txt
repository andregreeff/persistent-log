OK, so right now the api would be something like:

var storage = new plog.storage.LocalStorage();
plog.setLevel(plog.level.INFO);
plog.useStorage(storage);

plog.debug(...)
plog.info(...)
plog.warn(...)
plog.error(...)
plog.fatal(...)

var events = storage.getEvents();


TODO
----
Create readme file
  Write docs
Push to npm
Â¿Add a sample UI based on consolejs to show the last entries?
